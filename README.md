# University-Websites-UX
The world is a global village where online presence ensures
the existence of an entity. Like any other organization, official websites are also the faces of academic institutes in the
world wide web. They have many online visitors with multiple purposes and one important user group among them is
prospective students who want to pursue higher education
abroad. Many students around the world use these university
websites for most of their communications, yet from the user
experience perspective, how their search procedure is, how
well the information is served to them through these websites,
are still unexplored. In this exploratory research we have investigated the motives and factors that drive prospective students
to search necessary information, quantified how much effort
from their end is required to accomplish such tasks and finally
compared and analyzed our findings with usability score measured by a professional web user-experience analytics service
provider. The insights uncovered in this work might play a
major role in the designing phase of academic websites.
